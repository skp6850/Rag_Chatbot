Sellers can create rules to automate replacements, returns, and refunds under certain circumstances.\n2. For new sellers, listings where returns are accepted will have a default rule that automates the return process.\n3. If a seller has set up this automation, an eBay-generated return shipping label will be provided to the buyer.\n4. Sellers must comply with eBay's returns policy.\n5. Buyers generally do not have the right to cancel an order, but they can request cancellation within a specified time period and according to eBay's Order Cancellation Policy.\n6. If a seller accepts the request, they have 3 days to respond.\n7. In certain cases, if a buyer is responsible for return shipping costs, they may elect to use an eBay-generated shipping label or purchase one directly from a carrier.\n8. Sellers are responsible for paying the cost of an eBay-generated return shipping label.\n\nAdditionally, the following points relate to returns and refunds:\n\n* If a transaction is canceled after payment has been completed, eBay may issue a refund to the buyer on the seller's behalf and charge the seller for the amount of the refund.\n* Sellers can also be charged for the cost of return shipping labels and/or other reasonable fees from sellers when certain conditions are met (e.g., using an eBay-generated label, returns being automated, etc.).\n* The eBay Payment Entities may invoice sellers for these charges and collect such charges as described in the Payments Terms of Use.\n* Refund timing may vary in accordance with the rules of third parties, such as credit and debit card networks.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are also certain restrictions on returns and refunds, including:\n\n* Sellers must comply with eBay's Money Back Guarantee or other applicable terms.\n* The buyer is responsible for paying any fees associated with a refund (e.g., PayPal fees).\n* Refunds may not be issued in all cases, depending on the specific circumstances of the return."
